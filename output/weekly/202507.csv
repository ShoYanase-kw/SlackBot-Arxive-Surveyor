extraordinary comprehension capabilities with remarkable breakthroughs on
various vision-language tasks. However, the application of LLMs in generating
reliable medical diagnostic reports remains in the early stages. Currently,
medical LLMs typically feature a passive interaction model where doctors
respond to patient queries with little or no involvement in analyzing medical
images. In contrast, some ChatBots simply respond to predefined queries based
on visual inputs, lacking interactive dialogue or consideration of medical
history. As such, there is a gap between LLM-generated patient-ChatBot
interactions and those occurring in actual patient-doctor consultations. To
bridge this gap, we develop an LLM-based dialogue system, namely proactive
multi-round vision-language interactions for computer-aided diagnosis
(ProMRVL-CAD), to generate patient-friendly disease diagnostic reports. The
proposed ProMRVL-CAD system allows proactive dialogue to provide patients with
constant and reliable medical access via an integration of knowledge graph into
a recommendation system. Specifically, we devise two generators: a Proactive
Question Generator (Pro-Q Gen) to generate proactive questions that guide the
diagnostic procedure and a Multi-Vision Patient-Text Diagnostic Report
Generator (MVP-DR Gen) to produce high-quality diagnostic reports. Evaluating
two real-world publicly available datasets, MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray, our model
has better quality in generating medical reports. We further demonstrate the

Typically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related

tasks, aiming to develop an agent with generalizability across different
scenarios. Given the shared characteristics of tasks, the agent's learning
efficiency can be enhanced through parameter sharing. Existing approaches
typically use a routing network to generate specific routes for each task and
reconstruct a set of modules into diverse models to complete multiple tasks
simultaneously. However, due to the inherent difference between tasks, it is
crucial to allocate resources based on task difficulty, which is constrained by
the model's structure. To this end, we propose a Model Evolution framework with
Genetic Algorithm (MEGA), which enables the model to evolve during training
according to the difficulty of the tasks. When the current model is
insufficient for certain tasks, the framework will automatically incorporate
additional modules, enhancing the model's capabilities. Moreover, to adapt to
our model evolution framework, we introduce a genotype module-level model,
using binary sequences as genotype policies for model reconstruction, while
leveraging a non-gradient genetic algorithm to optimize these genotype
policies. Unlike routing networks with fixed output dimensions, our approach

reasoning for task planning. However, challenges remain under-explored for
parallel schedules. This paper introduces a novel paradigm, plan-over-graph, in
which the model first decomposes a real-life textual task into executable
subtasks and constructs an abstract task graph. The model then understands this
task graph as input and generates a plan for parallel execution. To enhance the
planning capability of complex, scalable graphs, we design an automated and
controllable pipeline to generate synthetic graphs and propose a two-stage
training scheme. Experimental results show that our plan-over-graph method
significantly improves task performance on both API-based LLMs and trainable

combine unsupervised implicit neural representations with the maximum

introduce locally linear reconstruction to ensure that regions lacking
correspondences between shapes still undergo physically natural deformations.

in graph learning, as real-world graph data often exhibit diverse and shifting
environments that traditional models fail to generalize across. A promising
solution to address this issue is graph invariant learning (GIL), which aims to
learn invariant representations by disentangling label-correlated invariant
subgraphs from environment-specific subgraphs. However, existing GIL methods
face two major challenges: (1) the difficulty of capturing and modeling diverse
environments in graph data, and (2) the semantic cliff, where invariant
subgraphs from different classes are difficult to distinguish, leading to poor
class separability and increased misclassifications. To tackle these

multi-prototype hyperspherical classification, which employs class prototypes
as intermediate variables to eliminate the need for explicit environment
modeling in GIL and mitigate the semantic cliff issue. Derived from the
theoretical framework of GIL, we introduce two novel objective functions: the
invariant prototype matching loss to ensure samples are matched to the correct
class prototypes, and the prototype separation loss to increase the distinction
between prototypes of different classes in the hyperspherical space. Extensive

To address the aforementioned challenges, we\nintroduce MultiLink, a novel framework that bridges the multilingual input to\nNoSQL query generation gap through a Parallel Linking Process. It breaks down\nthe task into multiple steps, integrating parallel multilingual processing,\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to\ntackle lexical and structural challenges inherent in multilingual NoSQL\ngeneration. MultiLink shows enhancements in all metrics for every language\nagainst the top baseline, boosting execution accuracy by about 15% for English\nand averaging a 10% improvement for non-English languages.'}","['Zhiqian Qin', 'Yuanfeng Song', 'Jinwei Lu', 'Yuanwei Song', 'Shuaimin Li', 'Chen Jason Zhang']",{'name': 'Chen Jason Zhang'},Chen Jason Zhang,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11022v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11022v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.CL', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.CL', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11022v1,None,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11022v1,,,37,0

challenge persists: the lack of high-quality optimization modeling datasets
hampers LLMs' robust modeling of practical optimization problems from natural
language descriptions (NL). This data scarcity also contributes to the
generalization difficulties experienced by learning-based methods. To address
these challenges, we propose a scalable framework for synthesizing a
high-quality dataset, named OptMATH. Starting from curated seed data with
mathematical formulations (MF), this framework automatically generates problem
data (PD) with controllable complexity. Then, a back-translation step is
employed to obtain NL. To verify the correspondence between the NL and the PD,
a forward modeling step followed by rejection sampling is used. The accepted
pairs constitute the training part of OptMATH. Then a collection of rejected

replaces forward KL divergence-whose mass-covering behavior risks overfitting

strong model is fine-tuned on the last layer, reverse KL uniquely guarantees
that it outperforms its weak supervisor by the magnitude of their

Additionally,\nmultiple safety companies and research institutions have confirmed critical\nsafety vulnerabilities in this model. As models demonstrating robust\nperformance in Chinese and English, DeepSeek models require equally crucial\nsafety assessments in both language contexts. However, current research has\npredominantly focused on safety evaluations in English environments, leaving a\ngap in comprehensive assessments of their safety performance in Chinese\ncontexts. In response to this gap, this study introduces CHiSafetyBench, a\nChinese-specific safety evaluation benchmark. This benchmark systematically\nevaluates the safety of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 in Chinese contexts,\nrevealing their performance across safety categories. The experimental results\nquantify the deficiencies of these two models in Chinese contexts, providing\nkey insights for subsequent improvements. It should be noted that, despite our\nefforts to establish a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative evaluation\nbenchmark, the selection of test samples, characteristics of data distribution,\nand the setting of evaluation criteria may inevitably introduce certain biases\ninto the evaluation results. We will continuously optimize the evaluation\nbenchmark and periodically update this report to provide more comprehensive and\naccurate assessment outcomes.

Traditional approaches rely on computationally expensive trained models or

established principles of saliency (LeCun et al., 1989) and connection
sensitivity (Lee et al., 2018) to tackle the challenging problem of one-shot
pruning neural networks (NNs) before training (PBT) at initialization. We
introduce Fisher-Taylor Sensitivity (FTS), a computationally cheap and
efficient pruning criterion based on the empirical Fisher Information Matrix
(FIM) diagonal, offering a viable alternative for integrating first- and
second-order information to identify a model's structurally important
parameters. Although the FIM-Hessian equivalency only holds for convergent
models that maximize the likelihood, recent studies (Karakida et al., 2019)
suggest that, even at initialization, the FIM captures essential geometric
information of parameters in overparameterized NNs, providing the basis for our
method. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that layer collapse, a critical
limitation of data-dependent pruning methodologies, is easily overcome by
pruning within a single training epoch after initialization. We perform

demonstrate that, for a same group of customer requests, compared with those
depots identified through random attempts, our framework can proactively
generate depots that lead to superior solution routes with lower routing cost.

involves progressively increasing the observation period from two weeks to

that shorter temporal windows are most effective when no feature rearrangement

Single-target instruction UIE enables the extraction of only one type of

Processing (NLP). Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to interpret
and generate code-switched text, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale
CS datasets for training. This paper presents a novel methodology to generate
CS data using LLMs, and test it on the English-Spanish language pair. We
propose back-translating natural CS sentences into monolingual English, and
using the resulting parallel corpus to fine-tune LLMs to turn monolingual
sentences into CS. Unlike previous approaches to CS generation, our methodology
uses natural CS data as a starting point, allowing models to learn its natural
distribution beyond grammatical patterns. We thoroughly analyse the models'
performance through a study on human preferences, a qualitative error analysis
and an evaluation with popular automatic metrics. Results show that our
methodology generates fluent code-switched text, expanding research
opportunities in CS communication, and that traditional metrics do not

Specifically, we show that the expressive power of KGFMs directly depends on
the motifs that are used to learn the relation representations. We then observe
that the most typical motifs used in the existing literature are binary, as the
representations are learned based on how pairs of relations interact, which
limits the model's expressiveness. As part of our study, we design more
expressive KGFMs using richer motifs, which necessitate learning relation
representations based on, e.g., how triples of relations interact with each
other. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings, showing that

classification and quality assessment rely on manual visual inspection, a
process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. However, with
advancements in machine vision technology, automating rice classification and

proposes a real-time evaluation mechanism for comprehensive rice grain

proposed framework enables rice variety identification, grain completeness
grading, and grain chalkiness evaluation. The rice grain dataset used in this
study comprises approximately 20,000 images from six widely cultivated rice
varieties in China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
mechanism achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.14% in the object

details are often rooted in real-world processes, we leverage a generative

contrastive models such as CLIP, which learn to associate visual information
with their corresponding text descriptions. However, these models have
limitations in understanding complex compositional scenes involving multiple
objects and their spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel approach that diverges from commonly used strategies, which
rely on the design of hard-negative augmentations. Instead, our work focuses on
integrating inductive biases into pre-trained CLIP-like models to improve their
compositional understanding without using any additional hard-negatives. To
that end, we introduce a binding module that connects a scene graph, derived
from a text description, with a slot-structured image representation,
facilitating a structured similarity assessment between the two modalities. We
also leverage relationships as text-conditioned visual constraints, thereby
capturing the intricate interactions between objects and their contextual
relationships more effectively. Our resulting model not only enhances the

shape-only morphing on untextured, topologically aligned datasets. This

condition features. We then explore an Attention Fusion strategy to generate
more smooth morphing sequences. To further improve the plausibility of semantic
interpolation and the generated 3D surfaces, we propose two strategies: (a)
Token Reordering, where we match approximate tokens based on semantic analysis
to guide implicit correspondences in the denoising process of the diffusion
model, and (b) Low-Frequency Enhancement, where we enhance low-frequency
signals in the tokens to improve the quality of generated surfaces.

task-specific applications through fine-tuning, extending these benefits across
diverse languages is essential for broad accessibility. However, effective
cross-lingual transfer is hindered by LLM performance gaps across languages and
the scarcity of fine-tuning data in many languages. Through analysis of LLM
internal representations from over 1,000+ language pairs, we discover that
middle layers exhibit the strongest potential for cross-lingual alignment.
Building on this finding, we propose a middle-layer alignment objective
integrated into task-specific training. Our experiments on slot filling,
machine translation, and structured text generation show consistent

Our approach features: (1) user-aware tuning that\nadapts interactions in real time using visual-linguistic signals; (2) bias\nmitigation via preference optimization; and (3) curated 360{\\deg} socio-emotive\ninteraction datasets annotated with demographic, emotion, and relational\nmetadata. Evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art\nresults: +35.3% F1 in personalized VQA, +47.5% F1 in facial features\nunderstanding, 15% bias reduction, and 30X speedup over baselines. Ablation\nstudies confirm component efficacy, and deployment on the Pepper robot\nvalidates real-time adaptability across diverse users.

The evaluation\nreveals that results generated through advanced prompt engineering achieve a\nhigher proportion of matches with ORKG properties, further emphasizing the\nenhanced alignment achieved. Moreover, this lays the groundwork for addressing\nchallenges such as the inconsistency of ORKG properties, an issue highlighted\nin prior studies. By assigning unique URIs and using standardized terminology,\nthis work increases the consistency of the properties, fulfilling a crucial\naspect of Linked Data and FAIR principles - core commitments of ORKG.

leverages both spectral features and the listener's audiogram as inputs, and we
investigate four architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), and
Transformer. We also introduce Denoising NeuroAMP, an extension that integrates
noise reduction along with amplification capabilities for improved performance
in real-world scenarios. To enhance generalization, a comprehensive data
augmentation strategy was employed during training on diverse speech (TIMIT and
TMHINT) and music (Cadenza Challenge MUSIC) datasets. Evaluation using the
Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI), Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index
(HASQI), and Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) demonstrates that the
Transformer architecture within NeuroAMP achieves the best performance, with
SRCC scores of 0.9927 (HASQI) and 0.9905 (HASPI) on TIMIT, and 0.9738 (HAAQI)
on the Cadenza Challenge MUSIC dataset. Notably, our data augmentation strategy
maintains high performance on unseen datasets (e.g., VCTK, MUSDB18-HQ).
Furthermore, Denoising NeuroAMP outperforms both the conventional NAL-R+WDRC
approach and a two-stage baseline on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, achieving a
10% improvement in both HASPI (0.90) and HASQI (0.59) scores. These results

NeuroAMP\nleverages both spectral features and the listener's audiogram as inputs, and we\ninvestigate four architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), and\nTransformer. We also introduce Denoising NeuroAMP, an extension that integrates\nnoise reduction along with amplification capabilities for improved performance\nin real-world scenarios. To enhance generalization, a comprehensive data\naugmentation strategy was employed during training on diverse speech (TIMIT and\nTMHINT) and music (Cadenza Challenge MUSIC) datasets. Evaluation using the\nHearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI), Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index\n(HASQI), and Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) demonstrates that the\nTransformer architecture within NeuroAMP achieves the best performance, with\nSRCC scores of 0.9927 (HASQI) and 0.9905 (HASPI) on TIMIT, and 0.9738 (HAAQI)\non the Cadenza Challenge MUSIC dataset. Notably, our data augmentation strategy\nmaintains high performance on unseen datasets (e.g., VCTK, MUSDB18-HQ).\nFurthermore, Denoising NeuroAMP outperforms both the conventional NAL-R+WDRC\napproach and a two-stage baseline on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, achieving a\n10% improvement in both HASPI (0.90) and HASQI (0.59) scores.

traditional tracking rewards - which simply guide the robot along a reference
trajectory - to task rewards that drive truly dynamic, goal-oriented behaviors.
Commands such as ""throw the ball as far as you can"" or ""lift the weight as
quickly as possible"" compel the robot to exhibit the agility and power inherent
in athletic performance. However, training solely with task rewards introduces
two major challenges: these rewards are prone to exploitation (reward hacking),
and the exploration process can lack sufficient direction. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage training pipeline. First, we introduce the
Unsupervised Actuator Net (UAN), which leverages real-world data to bridge the
sim-to-real gap for complex actuation mechanisms without requiring access to
torque sensing. UAN mitigates reward hacking by ensuring that the learned
behaviors remain robust and transferable. Second, we use a pre-training and

Recognizing the pressing need for more effective solutions, researchers have
turned to machine learning techniques to streamline the prediction and
development of novel antibiotic compounds. While foundation models have shown
promise in antibiotic discovery, current mainstream efforts still fall short of
fully leveraging the potential of multimodal molecular data. Recent studies

excellent performance in representation learning across various domains.

Key parameters include condition number, sparsity, and\nprecision $\\kappa, s\\approx{O}(10\\sim100)$, $\\epsilon\\sim0.01$, and physical\nerror $10^{-5}$. Our resource estimator adjusts $N, \\kappa, s, \\epsilon$,\nproviding a map of quantum-classical boundaries and revealing where a practical\nquantum advantage may arise.

spurred interest in ternary LLMs. Despite this, research and practical
applications focusing on efficient edge inference for ternary LLMs remain
scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce Bitnet.cpp, an inference system
optimized for BitNet b1.58 and ternary LLMs. Given that mixed-precision matrix
multiplication (mpGEMM) constitutes the bulk of inference time in ternary LLMs,
Bitnet.cpp incorporates a novel mpGEMM library to facilitate
sub-2-bits-per-weight, efficient and lossless inference. The library features
two core solutions: Ternary Lookup Table (TL), which addresses spatial
inefficiencies of previous bit-wise methods, and Int2 with a Scale (I2_S),
which ensures lossless edge inference, both enabling high-speed inference. Our
experiments show that Bitnet.cpp achieves up to a 6.25x increase in speed over
full-precision baselines and up to 2.32x over low-bit baselines, setting new
benchmarks in the field. Additionally, we expand TL to element-wise lookup
table (ELUT) for low-bit LLMs in the appendix, presenting both theoretical and

training-time scaling, and test-time scaling further enhances their
capabilities by conducting effective reasoning during inference. However, as
the scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer
from accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational
resources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue,
we observe that complex reasoning progress is often achieved by solving a
sequence of independent subquestions, each being self-contained and verifiable.
These subquestions are essentially atomic questions, relying primarily on their
current state rather than accumulated history, similar to the memoryless
transitions in a Markov process. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of
Thoughts (AoT), where each state transition in the reasoning process consists
of decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic
graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a new atomic question state.
This iterative decomposition-contraction process continues until reaching
directly solvable atomic questions, naturally realizing Markov transitions
between question states. Furthermore, these atomic questions can be seamlessly
integrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling AoT to serve as a
plug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across
six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AoT both as a standalone
framework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to
gpt-4o-mini, AoT achieves an 80.6% F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by 3.4% and

we explore instrumental convergence in LLMs by comparing models trained with

To assess this, we introduce InstrumentalEval, a benchmark for\nevaluating instrumental convergence in RL-trained LLMs. Initial experiments\nreveal cases where a model tasked with making money unexpectedly pursues\ninstrumental objectives, such as self-replication, implying signs of\ninstrumental convergence. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of\nalignment challenges in AI systems and the risks posed by unintended model\nbehaviors.'}","['Yufei He', 'Yuexin Li', 'Jiaying Wu', 'Yuan Sui', 'Yulin Chen', 'Bryan Hooi']",{'name': 'Bryan Hooi'},Bryan Hooi,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12206v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12206v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.CL', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12206v1,None,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12206v1,,,198,0

By mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and

systematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic
fluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also
explore the models capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop

complexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data
creation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set
of LLMs including Llama3, Gemma, Mixtral, Mistral, and Qwen. Results reveal
that while models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code, they
frequently exhibit logical errors in translating expert knowledge. Furthermore,
iterative self-correction yields only marginal improvements (up to 3%).

potential of Transformer language models like SBERT for preemptive grooming

vulnerable to the risk of grooming in online settings. Detecting grooming
instances in an online conversation poses a significant challenge as the
interactions are not necessarily sexually explicit, since the predators take
time to build trust and a relationship with their victim. Moreover, predators
evade detection using indirect and coded language. While previous studies have
fine-tuned Transformers to automatically identify grooming in chat
conversations, they overlook the impact of coded and indirect language on model
predictions, and how these align with human perceptions of grooming. In this
paper, we address this gap and evaluate bi-encoders on the task of classifying
different degrees of grooming risk in chat contexts, for three different
participant groups, i.e. law enforcement officers, real victims, and decoys.
Using a fuzzy-theoretic framework, we map human assessments of grooming
behaviors to estimate the actual degree of grooming risk. Our analysis reveals
that fine-tuned models fail to tag instances where the predator uses indirect
speech pathways and coded language to evade detection. Further, we find that
such instances are characterized by a higher presence of out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words in samples, causing the model to misclassify. Our findings
highlight the need for more robust models to identify coded language from noisy

runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while

CondensNet effectively mitigates water vapor oversaturation, enhancing

To address this, we\nintroduce CondensNet, a novel neural network architecture that embeds a\nself-adaptive physical constraint to correct unphysical condensation processes.\nCondensNet effectively mitigates water vapor oversaturation, enhancing\nsimulation stability while maintaining accuracy and improving computational\nefficiency compared to super parameterization schemes.\n  We integrate CondensNet into a GCM to form PCNN-GCM (Physics-Constrained\nNeural Network GCM), a hybrid deep learning framework designed for long-term\nstable climate simulations in real-world conditions, including ocean and land.\nPCNN-GCM represents a significant milestone in hybrid climate modeling, as it\nshows a novel way to incorporate physical constraints adaptively, paving the\nway for accurate, lightweight, and stable long-term climate simulations.""}","['Xin Wang', 'Juntao Yang', 'Jeff Adie', 'Simon See', 'Kalli Furtado', 'Chen Chen', 'Troy Arcomano', 'Romit Maulik', 'Gianmarco Mengaldo']",{'name': 'Gianmarco Mengaldo'},Gianmarco Mengaldo,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13185v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13185v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'physics.ao-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.ao-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13185v1,None,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13185v1,,,4447,0

However, existing LLM serving systems ignore dependencies between programs and
calls, missing significant opportunities for optimization. Our analysis reveals
that programs submitted to LLM serving engines experience long cumulative wait
times, primarily due to head-of-line blocking at both the individual LLM
request and the program. To address this, we introduce Autellix, an LLM serving
system that treats programs as first-class citizens to minimize their

enriching schedulers with program-level context. We propose two scheduling
algorithms-for single-threaded and distributed programs-that preempt and
prioritize LLM calls based on their programs' previously completed calls. Our

introduces a novel system that combines knowledge distillation and ensemble

only a subset of these student SNNs, the system balances accuracy and energy
efficiency, achieving substantial energy savings with minimal accuracy loss.
Moreover, SNE is significantly more efficient than the teacher network,
reducing computational requirements by up to 20x with only a 2% drop in
accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This disentanglement procedure achieves an
accuracy improvement of up to 2.4% on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to other

significant challenge. This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs)

System 1 and deliberate, slow System 2 processes. We investigate the potential
of AI to mimic diverse reasoning behaviors across a human population,
addressing what we call the {\em full reasoning spectrum problem}. We designed
reasoning tasks using a novel generalization of the Natural Language Inference
(NLI) format to evaluate LLMs' ability to replicate human reasoning. The
questions were crafted to elicit both System 1 and System 2 responses. Human
responses were collected through crowd-sourcing and the entire distribution was
modeled, rather than just the majority of the answers. We used
personality-based prompting inspired by the Big Five personality model to
elicit AI responses reflecting specific personality traits, capturing the
diversity of human reasoning, and exploring how personality traits influence
LLM outputs. Combined with genetic algorithms to optimize the weighting of
these prompts, this method was tested alongside traditional machine learning
models. The results show that LLMs can mimic human response distributions, with
open-source models like Llama and Mistral outperforming proprietary GPT models.
Personality-based prompting, especially when optimized with genetic algorithms,
significantly enhanced LLMs' ability to predict human response distributions,
suggesting that capturing suboptimal, naturalistic reasoning may require
modeling techniques incorporating diverse reasoning styles and psychological
profiles. The study concludes that personality-based prompting combined with

employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode implicit 3D geometries into a
latent space and a diffusion network to generate latents conditioned on input
prompts, with modifications to enhance model capacity. An alternative
Artist-Created Mesh (AM) generation approach is also explored, yielding

plugged into every stage, to enforce pixel-wise consistency among multi-view

existing denoising metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) are hardly to extend to
downstream real-world clinical research (e.g., Vessel morphology consistency).
2) There is a lack of comprehensive evaluation for both paired and unpaired

Intelligence is AI's ability to autonomously conduct research - what we term
Artificial General Research Intelligence (AGRI). If machines could generate
hypotheses, conduct experiments, and write research papers without human
intervention, it would transform science. Recently, Sakana.ai introduced the AI
Scientist, a system claiming to automate the research lifecycle, generating
both excitement and skepticism.
  We evaluated the AI Scientist and found it a milestone in AI-driven research.
While it streamlines some aspects, it falls short of expectations. Literature
reviews are weak, nearly half the experiments failed, and manuscripts sometimes
contain hallucinated results. Most notably, users must provide an experimental
pipeline, limiting the AI Scientist's autonomy in research design and
execution.
  Despite its limitations, the AI Scientist advances research automation. Many
reviewers or instructors who assess work superficially may not recognize its
output as AI-generated. The system produces research papers with minimal human
effort and low cost. Our analysis suggests a paper costs a few USD with a few
hours of human involvement, making it significantly faster than human
researchers. Compared to AI capabilities from a few years ago, this marks
progress toward AGRI.
  The rise of AI-driven research systems requires urgent discussion within
Information Retrieval (IR) and broader scientific communities. Enhancing
literature retrieval, citation validation, and evaluation benchmarks could
improve AI-generated research reliability. We propose concrete steps, including
AGRI-specific benchmarks, refined peer review, and standardized attribution
frameworks. Whether AGRI becomes a stepping stone to AGI depends on how the

Recently, Sakana.ai introduced the AI\nScientist, a system claiming to automate the research lifecycle, generating\nboth excitement and skepticism.\n  We evaluated the AI Scientist and found it a milestone in AI-driven research.\nWhile it streamlines some aspects, it falls short of expectations. Literature\nreviews are weak, nearly half the experiments failed, and manuscripts sometimes\ncontain hallucinated results. Most notably, users must provide an experimental\npipeline, limiting the AI Scientist's autonomy in research design and\nexecution.\n  Despite its limitations, the AI Scientist advances research automation. Many\nreviewers or instructors who assess work superficially may not recognize its\noutput as AI-generated. The system produces research papers with minimal human\neffort and low cost. Our analysis suggests a paper costs a few USD with a few\nhours of human involvement, making it significantly faster than human\nresearchers.

Additionally, we develop\nMMLongBench-Write, a benchmark featuring six tasks to evaluate the\nlong-generation capabilities of VLMs. Our 7B parameter model, trained with\nLongWriter-V-22k and IterDPO, achieves impressive performance on this\nbenchmark, outperforming larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.

due to the abstract and descriptive nature of chords in music analysis. While
audio chord recognition systems have achieved significant accuracy for small

long-tail distribution of chords, where rare chord types are underrepresented

recognition requires leveraging contextual information from audio sequences,

ChordFormer leverages conformer blocks that integrate convolutional neural
networks with transformers, thus enabling the model to capture both local
patterns and global dependencies effectively. By addressing challenges such as
class imbalance through a reweighted loss function and structured chord
representations, ChordFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a
2% improvement in frame-wise accuracy and a 6% increase in class-wise accuracy

Furthermore, ChordFormer excels in handling\nclass imbalance, providing robust and balanced recognition across chord types.\nThis approach bridges the gap between theoretical music knowledge and practical\napplications, advancing the field of large-vocabulary chord recognition.'}","['Muhammad Waseem Akram', 'Stefano Dettori', 'Valentina Colla', 'Giorgio Carlo Buttazzo']",{'name': 'Giorgio Carlo Buttazzo'},Giorgio Carlo Buttazzo,"13 pages, 4 figures","[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11840v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11840v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.SD', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.SD', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.CV', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.IR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11840v1,None,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11840v1,,,455,0

brain can advance our comprehension of human perceptual and cognitive
processing capabilities and contribute to developing brain-inspired computer
models. Recent encoding models using deep neural networks (DNNs) have
successfully predicted voxel-wise activity. However, interpreting the
properties that explain voxel responses remains challenging because of the
black-box nature of DNNs. As a solution, we propose LLM-assisted Visual Cortex
Captioning (LaVCa), a data-driven approach that uses large language models
(LLMs) to generate natural-language captions for images to which voxels are
selective. By applying LaVCa for image-evoked brain activity, we demonstrate
that LaVCa generates captions that describe voxel selectivity more accurately
than the previously proposed method. Furthermore, the captions generated by
LaVCa quantitatively capture more detailed properties than the existing method
at both the inter-voxel and intra-voxel levels. Furthermore, a more detailed
analysis of the voxel-specific properties generated by LaVCa reveals
fine-grained functional differentiation within regions of interest (ROIs) in
the visual cortex and voxels that simultaneously represent multiple distinct
